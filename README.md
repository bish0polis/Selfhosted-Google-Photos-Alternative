# Self-Hosted Photo Storage Solution
## Replacing Google Photos
After testing a lot (almost all of them) of alternatives and solutions. Finally I came up with the definitive solution, the one that gives me everything I want in an easy (once set up is done), cheap, secure and lightweight way.

At the end of this tutorial we will have a Photo Storage solution that will allow us to:

- [x] Sync our photos from any device.  
- [x] Remove exact-photo duplicates efficiently.  
- [x] Automatically organize our Gallery by Year and Month.  
- [x] Manually run Face Recognition and Face Scanning.  
- [x] Manage our gallery from DigiKam.  
- [x] Have an online gallery with a map, faces, tags, ratings and other filters.  
- [x] Upload an encrypted backup of our gallery to any cloud service.  
- [x] Locally generate a backup on a separated drive.  
- [x] Securelly access our Gallery from anywhere outside our network.  

This can be achieved using a Raspberry Pi 4 and a HDD Storage drive. Pretty cheap!
